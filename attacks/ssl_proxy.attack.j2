Feature: nmap attacks for scanme.nmap.org and to use this for your tests, change the value in the profile
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following profile:
      | name           | value        |
      | hostname       | {{ swift_proxy_ssl_proxy_server }}  |

  Scenario: Verify server is open on expected set of ports using the nmap fast flag
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -F <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should match:
      """
      22/tcp\s+open
      """

    Then the output should match:
      """
      443/tcp\s+open
      """

    Then the output should not contain:
      """
      80/tcp
      """
